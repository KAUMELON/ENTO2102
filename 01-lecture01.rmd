## Definition
**PEST** - Derived from French word `Peste` and Latin term `Pestis` meaning
plague or contagious disease

Pest is any animal which is noxious, destructive or troublesome to man
or his interests

A pest is any organism which occurs in large numbers and conflict with
man's welfare, convenience and profit

A pest is an organism which harms man or his property significantly or
is likely to do so (Woods, 1976)

Insects are pests when they are sufficiently numerous to cause economic
damage (Debacli, 1964)

**Pests are organisms which impose burdens on human population by
causing**

\(i\) Injury to crop plants, forests and ornamentals

\(ii\) Annoyance, injury and death to humans and domesticated animals

\(iii\) Destruction or value depreciation of stored products. --

Pests include insects, nematodes, mites, snails, slugs, etc. and
vertebrates like rats, birds, etc.

Depending upon the importance, pests may be agricultural forest,
household, medical, aesthetic and veterinary pests.

## Classification

### Based on occurrence

-   **Regular pest**: Frequently occurs on crop - Close association e.g.
    Rice stem borer, Brinjal fruit borer , cardamom thrips, chilli
    thrips

-   **Occasional pest**: Infrequently occurs, no close association with crop
    eg. Caseworm on rice, Mango stem borer

-   **Seasonal pest**: Occurs during a particular season every year.Depends
    on climatic parameters

-   e.g. Red hairy caterpillar on groundnut, Mango hoppers ,locust

-   **Persistent pests**: Occurs on the crop throughout the year and is
    difficult to control e.g. Chilli thrips, mealy bug on guava

-   **Sporadic pests**: Pest occurs in isolated localities during some
    period. e.g. Coconut slug caterpillar

### Based on level of infestation

-   **Epidemic pest** : Sudden outbreak of a pest in a severe form in a
    region at a particular time e.g. BPH in Tanjore, RHC in Madurai,
    Pollachi

-   **Endemic pest**: Occurrence of the pest in a low level in few pockets,
    regularly and confined to particular area e.g. Rice gall midge in
    Madurai,Kuttabadu, Mango hoppers in Periyakulam

## Parameters of insect population levels

### General equilibrium position (GEP)

-   The average density of a population over a long period of time,
    around which the pest population tends to fluctuate due to biotic
    and abiotic factors and in the absence of permanent environmental
    changes.

```{r GEP, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='General equilibrium position',out.width="40%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image1.png"))
```

### Economic threshold level (ETL)  
Population density at which control
measure should be implemented to prevent an increasing pest population
from reaching the EIL.

### Economic injury level (EIL)  
The lowest population density that will
cause economic damage

```{r EIL, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Economic Injury Level',out.width="40%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image2.png"))
```

### Damage boundary (DB)  
The lowest level of damage which can be measured.
```{r DB, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Damage Boundary',out.width="40%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/image3.png"))
```
## PEST CATEGORIES 
*ACCORDING TO EIL, GEP AND DB*

### Key pest  
Most severe and damaging pests - GEP always lies above EIL -
Spraying can temporarily bring population below EIL - These are
### persistent pests  
The environment must be changed to bring GEP below
EIL e.g. Cotton bollworm, Diamond backmoth

### Major pest  
GEP lies very close to EIL or coincides with EIL - Economic
damage can be prevented by timely and repeated sprays e.g. Cotton jassid, Rice stem borer

### Minor pest/Occasional pest  
GEP is below the EIL usually - Rarely they
cross EIL - Can be controlled by spraying e.g. Cotton stainers, Rice
hispa, Ash weevils

### Sporadic pests  
GEP generally below EIL - Sometimes it crosses EIL
and cause severe loss in some places/periods e.g. Sugarcane pyrilla,
White grub, Hairy caterpillar, Spodoptera

### Potential pests  
They are not pests at present - GEP always less
than EIL - If environment changes, it may cause economic loss .

e.g. *S. litura* is potential pest in North India
